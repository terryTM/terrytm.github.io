My research interests lie in developing novel theoretically justifiable and computationally efficient methods for tackling the computation burden brought about by the sheer size of large-scale datasets. My ongoing research interests are as follows.
* Statistical machine learning
* Subsampling methods in big data
* Large-scale optimal transport problems
* Non/Semi-parametric modeling
* Generative models
* Statistical applications in imaging data, LiDAR data and 3d point cloud data
